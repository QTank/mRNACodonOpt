# mRNA codon optimization
This method is from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14858. For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the paper. The method required fewer qubits than the existing method.


You can run the solution.py in the folder solution. The example protein sequence is from P0DTC2. Of course, you can optimize one sequence that you want.
